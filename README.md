Welcome to my internship project repository with Oasis Infobyte! In this repository, you'll find the Java code for an ATM interface that I developed during my internship. The project consists of five essential classes: 

1. TransactionHistory: This class handles the transaction history of the ATM, keeping a record of all the transactions made by the users.

2. Withdraw: The Withdraw class facilitates cash withdrawal functionality, allowing users to withdraw funds from their accounts.

3. Deposit: The Deposit class enables users to deposit money into their accounts through the ATM interface.

4. Quit: This class provides a clean and secure way for users to exit the ATM interface when they are done with their transactions.

5. Transfer: The Transfer class is responsible for handling fund transfers between different accounts.

To ensure data persistence and manage user information efficiently, I used SQL as the database for this project.

Feel free to explore the code, and any feedback or suggestions are highly appreciated! Happy coding!
