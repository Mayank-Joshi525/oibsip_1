# Oasis Infobyte Internship - ATM Interface Project

## Description

Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Internship project repository! In this repository, you'll find the Java code for an interactive ATM interface. The project revolves around creating a user-friendly ATM system, consisting of five essential classes: TransactionHistory, Withdraw, Deposit, Quit, and Transfer. The primary goal of this project is to allow users to perform various banking tasks through a command-line interface.

## Classes

1. **TransactionHistory:** This class is responsible for maintaining a log of all the transactions made by users. It keeps track of deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and other account activities.

2. **Withdraw:** The Withdraw class facilitates the process of cash withdrawals. It allows users to withdraw funds from their accounts securely.

3. **Deposit:** The Deposit class enables users to deposit money into their accounts using the ATM interface. It ensures smooth and reliable money transfer to the user's account.

4. **Quit:** The Quit class provides a clean and secure way for users to exit the ATM interface after completing their transactions.

5. **Transfer:** The Transfer class handles fund transfers between different accounts. Users can transfer funds from their account to another account using this class.

## Database

For efficient data management and persistence, the project uses SQL as the database. It stores user account details, transaction history, and other essential information securely.

## User Authentication

The ATM interface incorporates a robust user authentication mechanism. Before accessing the menu of ATM tasks, users must provide their unique user ID and PIN. Once verified, they gain access to the menu, enabling them to perform the desired tasks.

## Setup Instructions

To run the code successfully, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Download the appropriate .jar file for connecting SQL and Java.
2. Create a connection to the SQL database using the connector.
3. Implement the rest of the code to enable ATM functionality.

## Explore and Contribute

Feel free to explore the code and understand how the ATM interface works. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate them. Contributions are always welcome, so if you find any bugs or improvements, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope you find this project insightful and helpful for your own development journey. Happy coding!
